# Overview

## Mission

What if anyone in the world could publish digital content, anyone else in the world could access it (for free or for payment), and that entire system worked without any centralized authority or point of control?

<MissionStatement/>

That's a fancy sentence, so here's a plain one: we thought it'd be *damn **cool*** if there was a system that made it easy to discover and distribute as much of the world's information as possible but was owned and controlled by no one.

> [1] In the information theoretic sense, LBRY facilitates distribution of all data, whether it be a video or a spreadsheet. {#footnote-1}

> [2] Accessible anywhere in the world on any internet-connected device. {#footnote-2}

> [3] Not controlled by any one person, party or authority. {#footnote-3}

> [4] Resistant to censorship or attempts to control; impervious to attacks or disruptions. {#footnote-4}

> [5] In the Pareto sense, with regards to the production and distribution of information (i.e. digital information is both created and distributed in a way that could not be any more efficient from the perspectives of information producers and consumers). {#footnote-5}

> [6] The most complete collection of world’s books, films, art, games, etc. should be available via LBRY. {#footnote-6}
